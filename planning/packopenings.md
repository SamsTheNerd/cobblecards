Want to give available cards, expected card pull slots (common, energy, rare, etc) and get a randomized list of cards back.
Slots have to have some knowledge of eachother to prevent duplicates.

Also want to have a way to modify rates, not sure if we want that to be hardcoded or more expandable, probably more expandable? 

some rare-like cards get their own slot or go with reverse holo slot - not sure how to handle reverse holos in general though

Also want to consider how more cards affect rarity rates - should we decide rarity first and then pick from there ? probably ? that makes it hard to modify the rates based on boosting specific cards though. mm ok new idea: decide weight for the rarity and then split it across the number of cards and do the randomization selection.
